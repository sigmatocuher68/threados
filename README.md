# threados
very simple threaded DoS attack.  
uses requests.get to send get requests to a target at a fairly fast speed.  
this is pretty much my first python project.

# how to use/requirements
open a terminal and enter the following command:  
``pip install requests``  
after that you can open the .py file  
OR open it through a terminal (``python threados.py``)  
target is the domain you want to target (self explanatory)  
type that in and it will start sending requests!  
(to stop it just close the terminal)
